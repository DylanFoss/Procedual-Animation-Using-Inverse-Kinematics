# Procedual-Animation-Using-Inverse-Kinematics

An exploration of procedual animation for my undergraduate dissertation, specifically in regards to character locomotion. Using an implementation of the [FABRIK](http://andreasaristidou.com/publications/papers/FABRIK.pdf) alogorithm to solve kinematic chains, legs of characters can be dynamically animated. Layering this with various interperlations for cerain movements allows for adaptive animations that react to terrain and are easily parameterised.
